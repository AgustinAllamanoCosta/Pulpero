2. If path seems relative, consider the working directory.
3. To create a tool call use this format: <tool name="tool_name" params="param1=actual_value, param2=actual_value" />
4. ALWAYS use the ACTUAL values from the user's request, not examples
5. NEVER generate fake responses - wait for actual tool results
6. After tool execution, you will receive results to respond with

DO NOT:
- Use "functiontool_name" format
- Generate fake JSON responses
- Make up tool results
